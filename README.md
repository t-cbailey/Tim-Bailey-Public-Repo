# NC Games- backend
## Overview
Nc Games is a Reddit Style web app with a focus on board games. The backend usues a PostgreSQL database and allows users to sign in, post reviews, like reviews, comment on reviews and delete their own comments. I built NC Games while on the Northcoders software development bootcamp in May 2023. 


## Instructions

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. To run this repo locally you will need two .env files:
.env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names)
